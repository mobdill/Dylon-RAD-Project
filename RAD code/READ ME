Was able to figure out ssh problem with the pi by simply changing some interface settings on the pi through the desktop. 
This will hopefully allow me to post to Github a lot more easily. 

I also figured out how to connect the camera/occupancy sensor to the data base and am working on sending points to the database.
May need some assistance next week with the temperature sensor.
i suggest us coming up with some code from scratch.
